"""Helper models at a fixed commit, checked by their SHA-256.

The content filter, the filling model (LaMa), the colouring model (DDColor), the photo tools, the ControlNets, pose and
depth detection and the upscaling model come from third-party repositories. A later commit there could change what
they do (a content filter that lets everything pass), so every file is fetched at the commit the app was tested with
and its checksum is compared. Once a folder is complete and checked, it is used from the disk without asking Hugging
Face again. The pins of the helpers are in helper_pins.json (tools/pin_helpers.py writes it).
