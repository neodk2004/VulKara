"""The release gate for the runtimes' Python packages (tools/release.mjs runs it before every build, also with
--skip-checks):

  1. every engine requirement is pinned (`name==version`) and has a lock (constraints.txt), the two agree;
  2. the lock was accepted: the runtimes installed on this Mac — the ones the tests and test pictures ran on — hold
     exactly the locked set. A lock changed without installing and testing it here does not pass.

    python3 tools/check_pins.py          exit code 0 when everything is locked and accepted, 1 with a list
